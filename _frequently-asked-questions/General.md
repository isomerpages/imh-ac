<p><strong>Q: What does the Autism Collaborative (AC) aim to achieve? </strong>
<br>We hope to create a network of professionals and individuals in the autism
community to grow our knowledge and understanding of autism, thereby increasing
our capacity to support the community. See more <a href="https://asdcollaborative.sg/about-us/who-we-are/" rel="noopener nofollow" target="_blank">here</a>.</p>
<p><strong>Q: I am a general public member who wants to learn more about autism. If I am neither a professional nor a member of the autism community, can I still join the AC network? </strong>
<br>A: Drop us an email <a href="https://www.asdcollaborative.sg/contact-us/" rel="noopener nofollow" target="_blank">here</a> to
let us know that you are interested in joining us. You may also wish to
indicate your interest in specific AC programmes and we will get back to
you on your eligibility.</p>
<p><strong>Q: What is the commitment level for joining the AC network? </strong>
<br>A: Commitment level would depend on whether you are a professional or
a member of the autism community and the AC activities you sign up for.
Be assured that you are not obligated to participate in any of our programmes.
What's most important is to have a heart for the autism community in Singapore!</p>
