<p><strong>Q: What is the commitment level for professionals who are part of the network? </strong>
<br>A: Commitment level differs depending on the specific research and/or
training activities you signed up for. Please find more information about
specific AC programmes on our website. Be assured that you are not obligated
to participate in any of our programmes.</p>
<p><strong>Q: I am a professional who is not working in the autism field. Can I still join the professionals network and participate in the programmes? </strong>
<br>A: Rest assured that not all programmes conducted by AC require prior
expertise in the autism field. Professionals who wish to learn more about
Autism Spectrum Disorder (ASD) are welcome to participate in training programmes.
However, certain programmes may require participants to be equipped with
certain knowledge and experience. To find out if the specific programmes
are suitable for you, please refer to the eligibility criteria of the programme
before registering your interest. Alternatively, you may join our professionals
network and we will contact you when there are programmes you are eligible
for.</p>
<p><strong>Q: How many years of experience in the ASD field is required for me to participate in the programmes? </strong>
<br>A: There is a wide variety of programmes that are available to professionals
of differing expertise. Please refer to the eligibility criteria of each
programme before registering your interest. If you are unsure of your eligibility
for a particular research and/or training programme, you may send in an
enquiry with us <a href="https://asdcollaborative.sg/contact-us/" rel="noopener nofollow" target="_blank">here</a>.</p>
<p><strong>Q: How can the Autism Collaborative support my research work?</strong>
<br>A: If you intend to conduct or are already conducting research about autism,
please write in to us so that we may support you according to your study's
needs. We may put up information regarding your study on our website, thus
helping with participant recruitment or awareness about your study. If
you are keen, we may also provide mentorship and guidance where appropriate.</p>
