<p><strong>Q: What is the commitment level like for members of the Autism community and their caregivers?</strong>
<br>A: Commitment level differs depending on which AC research and/or partnership
activities you signed up for. Please find more information about specific
AC programmes on our website. Be assured that you are not obligated to
participate in any of our programmes.</p>
<p><strong>Q: How can I contribute to the AC network as an individual with autism or a caregiver of an individual with autism?</strong> 
<br>You can work in partnership with us by volunteering your time to share
your knowledge and experiences with professionals at various AC activities.
You may also be eligible to participate in some research projects to help
further our understanding of autism. Do join our network and we will update
you when there are activities that may interest you!</p>
