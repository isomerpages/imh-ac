<p><strong>Q: What is the commitment level like for members of the Autism community and their caregivers?</strong>
<br>A: Commitment level differs depending on which AC research and/or partnership
activities you signed up for. Please find more information about specific
AC activities on our website. Be assured that you are not obligated to
participate in any AC activities.</p>
<p><strong>Q: How can I contribute to the AC network as a caregiver of a person with Autism?</strong> 
<br>You can work in partnership with us by volunteering your time to share
your knowledge and experiences with professionals at various AC activities.
