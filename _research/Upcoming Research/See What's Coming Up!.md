<p><strong>Project BRIDGE: Building inclusive workplaces for autistic adults through co-created AI tools</strong>
</p>
<p>The National Institute of Education (NIE, NTU) is conducting a study to
explore how they can better support workplace inclusion for autistic* adults
through participatory research.</p>
<p></p>
<p>They are currently looking for autistic adults (21 years and above) with
at least 3 months of work experience - past or current - to join their
study. Participants will take part in an online survey and a 2.5hr in-person
workshop that includes dissolutions and a hands-on activity with a large
language model (LLM) chatbot.</p>
<p></p>
<p>Participation is voluntary and confidential, and participants may receive
a $50 compensation upon completing the workshop and surveys. Round trip
private transport costs to the workshop venue can also be supported.</p>
<p></p>
