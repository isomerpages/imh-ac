<p><strong>A Survey on Sensitive Language Use in the Autism Community</strong>
</p>
<p></p>
<p>The language and labels we use in describing autism have an integral role
in shaping social perception and understanding of autism. In order to be
an inclusive society that understands and embraces autism, we aspire to
avoid words that could stigmatize or be divisive, aiming instead for more
mindful and considerate language use.</p>
<p></p>
<p>We are therefore conducting a public survey to understand the perspectives
and preferences of the autistic community in Singapore (please see poster
above). We really hope that as many people as possible can participate
for the results to be truly representative of as many voices as possible.</p>
<p></p>
<p>If you are interested, please scan the QR code in the poster or click
on the link below to launch the survey. If you have already participated,
thank you and please do not complete the survey again.</p>
