<h3>For The Autism Community &amp; Their Caregivers</h3>
<p>By participating in research, members of the autism community not only
contribute to causes they believe in but also support the acquisition of
knowledge that can further the wellbeing and services for the autism community.
We believe the autism community should and can have a voice to inform the
research community about what is important to them. We hope to foster better
collaboration and understanding of autism, by working together and inculcating
a culture of communication and bridging understanding.</p>
<p>We invite individuals with autism and their caregivers to join us in this
network. Participants will receive information about studies seeking volunteers
for participation, and also receive updates or reports about outcomes of
studies.</p>
