<p>Many individuals with autism and their caregivers may not require medical
or support services continuously. However, they may benefit from intermittent
support at different stages in their life. Similarly, there are many individuals
with autism and their caregivers who are able to share expertise, experience
and other resources with other members of the autism community, and even
with the professional community.</p>
<p>We would like to build a platform and network whereby individuals with
autism and their families can come together to access services, or even
help build and provide services in their own capacity.</p>
<p>We would like to invite participation in many programs, such as participating
in ...</p>
<p>1.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Professionals' intervention and/or
diagnosis training programs as volunteers</p>
<p>2.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sharing sessions and/or joining
in activities to support advocacy of the autism community</p>
