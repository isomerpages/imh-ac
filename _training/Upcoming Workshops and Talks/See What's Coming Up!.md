<p></p>
<p>The Department of Child Development (DCD), KK Women’s and Children’s Hospital
(KKH) is organising the Developmental Paediatrics Conference from <strong>14 to 16 July 2026.</strong> The
theme of the conference is <em>“</em><strong><em>From awareness to action: Fostering resilience and positive mental health in children and families</em></strong><em>”, </em>emphasising
the critical role of families and caregivers in supporting children with
developmental needs</p>
<p>The conference will bring together like-minded leading local and international
professionals, fostering collaboration and exchange among medical professionals,
allied health practitioners, early intervention specialists, and educators.
It will highlight the importance of strong partnerships between practitioners
and families in creating supportive environments that promote resilience
and mental well-being.</p>
<p>We warmly invite you to save the date. Registrations and call for abstracts
will open in mid-Jan 2026. To stay updated, please sign up for the <a href="https://for.sg/dpc-enquiry-form" rel="noopener nofollow" target="_blank">mailing list</a>,
