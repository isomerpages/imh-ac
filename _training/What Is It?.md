<p>We endeavour to deliver bespoke training programmes to further advance
the quality of education and services of the professional community to
serve the autism community. These include workshops and training programs
catered to professionals with different level of expertise. We also hope
to build a network of professionals who can reliably consult and support
each other in the professional growth, and in turn benefit the autism community
whom they serve.</p>
<p>We believe there are many areas of expertise beyond the organizational
boundaries and hope to work towards a sharing of knowledge not bound by
these limits.</p>
