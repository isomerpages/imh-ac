<p></p>
<p>The language and labels we use in describing autism have an integral role
in shaping social perception and understanding of autism. In order to be
an inclusive society that understands and embraces autism, we aspire to
avoid words that could stigmatize or be divisive, aiming instead for more
mindful and considerate language use.</p>
<p></p>
<p>The Autism Language Survey team from KKH &amp; NUH CDUs is therefore conducting
a public survey to understand the perspectives and preferences of the autistic
community in Singapore (please see poster above). We really hope that as
many people as possible can participate for the results to be truly representative
of as many voices as possible.</p>
<p></p>
<p>If you are interested, please scan the QR code in the poster or click
on this <a href="https://for.sg/autism-language-survey" rel="noopener nofollow" target="_blank">link</a> to
launch the survey. If you have already participated, thank you and please
do not complete the survey again.</p>
