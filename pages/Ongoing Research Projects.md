<p>A research team from IMH is conducting a systematic review to better understand
autistic meltdowns, shutdowns, and overwhelm and they want to ensure their
work reflects real experiences and perspectives. For this, they are looking
for 1-2 eligible individuals to join their research team to help with the
interpretation and contextualisation of findings.</p>
