<p>Autism Spectrum Disorder (ASD) is a neurodevelopmental disorder that affects
the individual's social communication and how he/she interacts with the
environment. Often, individuals with ASD face challenges understanding
and interacting with others socially and may also encounter behavioural
challenges.</p>
<p></p>
<p>While an exact prevalence rate has not been established, it is estimated
that roughly 1% of the total population in Singapore is on the spectrum.
While ASD may affect anyone, males are more likely to be diagnosed with
ASD as compared to females.</p>
<p></p>
<p>Just like everyone else, individuals with ASD are uniquely diverse - each
with own set of strengths, challenges and personality.</p>
