<p>Autism Spectrum Disorder (ASD) is a neurodevelopmental disorder that impacts
an individual's social communication and interaction with their environment.
Often, individuals with ASD face challenges in understanding and engaging
with others socially, and may also encounter behavioural difficulties.</p>
<p></p>
<p>While an exact prevalence rate has not been established, it is estimated
that roughly 1% of the total population in Singapore is on the autism spectrum.
While ASD can affect anyone, males are more likely to be diagnosed with
ASD as compared to females.</p>
<p></p>
<p>Like everyone else, individuals with ASD are uniquely diverse - each possessing
their own strengths, challenges and personalities.</p>
