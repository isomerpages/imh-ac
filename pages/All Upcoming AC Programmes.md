<p><strong>Project BRIDGE: Building inclusive workplaces for autistic adults through co-created AI tools</strong>
</p>
<p>The National Institute of Education (NIE, NTU) is conducting a study to
explore how they can better support workplace inclusion for autistic* adults
through participatory research.</p>
<p></p>
<p>They are currently looking for autistic adults (21 years and above) with
at least 3 months of work experience - past or current - to join their
study. Participants will take part in an online survey and a 2.5hr in-person
workshop that includes dissolutions and a hands-on activity with a large
language model (LLM) chatbot.</p>
<p></p>
<p>Participation is voluntary and confidential, and participants may receive
a $50 compensation upon completing the workshop and surveys. Round trip
private transport costs to the workshop venue can also be supported.</p>
<p></p>
<p>More information can be found on their <a href="https://sites.google.com/g.nie.edu.sg/project-bridge/home?authuser=0" rel="noopener nofollow" target="_blank">website</a>.

<summary><strong>Sensitive Language Use in the Autism Community</strong>

<p></p><a class="isomer-image-wrapper" href="https://for.sg/autism-language-survey"><img style="width: 100%" height="auto" width="100%" alt="" src="/images/Autism_Language_Survey_Recruitment_Poster_v1_2_dated_20_Nov_2023__Square_Format__page_0001.jpg"></a>
<p><strong>A Survey on Sensitive Language Use in the Autism Community</strong>
</p>
<p>The language and labels we use in describing autism have an integral role
in shaping social perception and the understanding of autism. In order
to be an inclusive society that understands and embraces autism, we aspire
to avoid words that could stigmatize or be divisive, aiming instead for
more mindful and considerate language use.</p>
<p></p>
<p>The Autism Language Survey team is therefore conducting a public survey
to understand the perspectives and preferences of the autistic community
(including caregivers and professionals) in Singapore. Further details
about the survey and how to participate are in the above poster. We really
hope that as many people as possible can participate for the results to
be truly representative of as many voices as possible. If you have already
responded to this survey before, there is no need to participate again.</p>
<p></p>
<p>If you are interested, please scan the QR code in the poster or click
on this <a href="https://for.sg/autism-language-survey" rel="noopener nofollow" target="_blank">link</a> to
access the survey. Thank you.</p>
<p></p>
<p><strong><em>The closing date for the survey is 31 July.</em></strong>
